Link: ti-connectivity/wl1271-nvs.bin -> wl127x-nvs.bin

Licence: See LICENCE.ti-connectivity for details.

The NVS file includes two parts:
	 - radio calibration
	 - HW configuration parameters (aka. INI values)

The published NVS files are for testing only.  Every device needs to
hava a unique NVS which is properly calibrated for best results.  You
can find more information about NVS generation for your device here:

http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/wl12xx/calibrator

If you're using a wl127x based device, use a symbolic link called
wl1271-nvs.bin that links to the wl127x-nvs.bin file.  If you are
using wl128x, link to wl128x-nvs.bin instead.

The driver expects to find the firmwares under a ti-connectivity
subdirectory.  So if your system looks for firmwares in /lib/firmware,
the firmwares for wl12xx chips must be located in
/lib/firmware/ti-connectivity/.

    These firmware should be put under /lib/firmware/rtw88/
    And note that the rtw88 driver is able to support wake-on-wireless LAN
    for RTL8822C devices, after kernel v5.6+. So, make sure the firmware
    rtw88/rtw8822c_wow_fw.bin is also packed, otherwise the firmware load
    fail could be a problem.
    Although RTL8723D devices are 802.11n device, they are also supported
    by rtw88 because the hardware arch is similar.
